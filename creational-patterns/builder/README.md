# Builder Design Pattern in Vim9script

## Overview

The **Builder Pattern** is a creational design pattern that constructs complex objects step by step. It separates construction from representation so the same process can produce different results.

## Intent

- Build complex objects incrementally
- Separate construction from representation
- Provide fine-grained control over object creation

## Also Known As

- None

## When to Use

Use the Builder pattern when:
- You have complex objects with many optional parts
- You want the same construction process to yield different representations
- You want to avoid long parameter lists in constructors

## Structure

```
Director -> Builder -> Product
```

## Participants

1. **Builder**: Defines construction steps (`ComputerBuilder`)
2. **Concrete Builders**: Implement steps (`GamingComputerBuilder`, `WorkstationBuilder`)
3. **Director**: Orchestrates steps (`ComputerDirector`)
4. **Product**: The complex object (`Computer`)

## Implementation in Vim9script

The example uses Vim9 classes, abstract classes, and method chaining:

```vim
abstract class ComputerBuilder
  abstract def BuildCPU(): void
  abstract def BuildRAM(): void
  abstract def GetComputer(): Computer
endclass
```

## Examples Included

### 1. Computer Configuration Builder
**Scenario**: Build gaming, workstation, laptop, and budget configurations.

**Components**:
- Builder: `ComputerBuilder`
- Concrete Builders: `GamingComputerBuilder`, `WorkstationBuilder`, `LaptopBuilder`, `BudgetComputerBuilder`
- Director: `ComputerDirector`
- Product: `Computer`

**Usage**:
```vim
var builder = GamingComputerBuilder.new()
var director = ComputerDirector.new(builder)
var computer = director.Construct()
```

## Running the Examples

### Source the file
```vim
:source builder_pattern.vim
```

### Run the complete demo
```vim
:call g:RunBuilderPatternDemo()
```

### Run the fluent demo
```vim
:call g:RunFluentBuilderDemo()
```

## Key Concepts Demonstrated

1. **Step-by-Step Construction** via builder methods
2. **Director Orchestration** for consistent creation
3. **Flexible Construction** by using the builder directly

## Advantages

1. **Separation of Concerns**: Construction logic is isolated
2. **Flexibility**: Same steps can create different products
3. **Clarity**: Each build step is explicit

## Disadvantages

1. **More Classes**: Builders and directors add types
2. **Setup Overhead**: More code for small objects

## Related Patterns

- **Abstract Factory**: Creates related object families
- **Factory Method**: Creates a single product type
- **Prototype**: Clones preconfigured products

## Vim9script Notes

- Abstract classes define required build steps
- Method chaining keeps build flow readable
- Global demo functions provide easy entry points

## Requirements

- Vim 9.0 or later (for Vim9script class support)
- No external dependencies

## Conclusion

The Builder pattern separates construction from representation, making complex object creation clearer and more flexible. This Vim9script example demonstrates multiple builders orchestrated by a director.
